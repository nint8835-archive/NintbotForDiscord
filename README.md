Nintbot for Discord is a bot designed for the [Discord](https://discordapp.com) voice and text chat software.

It is fully modular through the use of a plugin system.

It was designed and programmed before the official Discord.py plugin system was put into place, meaning it serves little purpose anymore, but I still use it.
